Grades percentage prediction based on the hours of study

Regression Modeling: Utilize a regression model to predict grades based on the number of hours a student studies.
  
Correlation: Assume a positive correlation between study hours and academic performance; more study hours typically lead to higher grades.

Training Data: Train the model using historical data that includes both study hours and corresponding grades.

Prediction: The model learns the relationship and can then predict grades for new data points based on study hours.

Simplification: The model simplifies the complex relationship between study time and academic performance, considering it as a linear or non-linear correlation.

Factors Consideration: Acknowledge that other factors may influence grades, and this model focuses primarily on the study time and grade relationship.
